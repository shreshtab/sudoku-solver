Another pause. Organized and styled the components a bit better

After a small hiatus, I'm back to work on this! Mobile responsive design is complete, with a couple of small snags which will be resolved soon. Next, will look to refactor components to make them a bit more organized and will also add some unit tests. Thinking both snapshot and integration testing. Unit testing with Redux will be a good thing to learn.

Made some decently consistent progress over the last few weeks! Got the solver visualizer working and even got a slider to control the solve speed. Now onto styling and making sure it is responsive across all device sizes. Looking forward to the next steps with it!

One month later, I'm picking up this project again. The algorithm is done and solved a similar problem on AlgoExpert recently. I'm going to initiate the solve as an async action using Redux Thunk. Let's see how it goes!

As someone who enjoyed doing Sudoku puzzles growing up, I was intrigued on how to solve a Sudoku puzzle via code. I decided to create this project to deepen my own understanding of recursion and backtracking algorithms and to hone my front-end skills.
